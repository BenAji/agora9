**Tip:** Use collaborative tools (Google Docs, Notion, Figma, Lucidchart, etc.) for living documents. Keep documents up to date as the project evolves. Involve both technical and non-technical stakeholders in reviewing requirements and flows. Prioritize clarity and completeness—good documentation saves time and money!
