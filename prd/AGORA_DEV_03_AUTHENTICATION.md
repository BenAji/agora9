## üéØ What You'll Accomplish

- ‚úÖ Configure Microsoft Azure App Registration for Office add-ins
- ‚úÖ Implement role-based authentication (`investment_analyst` vs `executive_assistant`)
- ‚úÖ Create Executive Assistant delegation authentication system
- ‚úÖ Set up subscription-aware authentication flows
- ‚úÖ Implement user switching capabilities for Executive Assistants
- ‚úÖ Create permission matrix enforcement for user story restrictions
- ‚úÖ Set up notification authentication for multi-user EA management
- ‚úÖ Implement session security with role-based context

```

### **User Story Requirements Mapped to Authentication:**

1. **Investment Analyst Authentication**:
   - Role: `'investment_analyst'`
   - Own subscription management
   - Own calendar and event access
   - Cannot access other users' data

2. **Executive Assistant Authentication**:
   - Role: `'executive_assistant'`
   - Multi-user delegation context
   - Operational task permissions for assisted users
   - Restricted from sensitive analytics/private notes
   - Notification permissions for all assisted users

3. **Subscription-Based Access Control**:
   - Authentication integrates with subscription status
   - Immediate access removal when subscriptions expire
   - Payment-required authentication redirects
